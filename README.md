An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).
The code creates an interactive chat application using Gradio and HuggingFace's Inference API to discuss stress management. It provides a predefined system message about stress management techniques and psychotherapies. Users can ask questions, and the app generates contextually relevant responses based on user input, with configurable response parameters.
